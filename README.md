# Agentic AI Healthcare Assistant

## Problem Statement
Patients often struggle to interpret medical reports, understand their symptoms, and identify the right treatment options. Existing digital healthcare tools fall short in providing:

- *Medical reliability* — Many apps lack verified or explainable medical insights.  
- *Personalization* — One-size-fits-all recommendations don’t consider patient history or unique health contexts.  
- *Continuity* — Tools often fail to remember user interactions or maintain health records effectively.

To address this gap, *we propose an Agentic AI Healthcare Assistant* that integrates the latest advances in *Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), **multimodal understanding, and **ML-driven risk analysis* to deliver safe, accurate, and personalized medical guidance.  


##  Key Features
- *RAG-Powered Insights*: Retrieve trusted medical knowledge from verified databases to ensure reliability.  
- *Multimodal Input Understanding*: Analyze text, images (like x-rays or reports), and speech for a complete understanding of patient input.  
- *AI-Powered Personalization*: Leverages user health history and behavior for tailored recommendations.  
- *ML Risk Prediction Models*: Estimate risk levels for common conditions using contextual data.  
- *Privacy and Safety First*: Ensures HIPAA-compliant data handling and responsible AI use.
