# 🏥 Agentic AI Healthcare Assistant

## 📌 Problem Statement

Patients often struggle to interpret complex medical reports, understand their symptoms, and identify appropriate treatment options. Existing digital healthcare tools lack medical reliability, true personalization, and the ability to retain and learn from a patient’s historical medical data.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

To address these challenges, we propose an **Agentic AI Healthcare Assistant** that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **multimodal understanding**, and **machine learning–based risk analysis** to provide **safe, accurate, and personalized medical guidance**.

The system acts as an intelligent healthcare companion that understands medical documents, remembers patient history, analyzes symptoms, and assists users in making informed healthcare decisions.
